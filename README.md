# ATG Environment Running On Docker

# Current Status

* Endeca 3.1.1 install works
* Endeca 3.1.2 install works
* JBoss eap 5.1.2 install works
* ATG install is in progress
* docker-compose is in progress

# Goals

A quick and repeatable install for development or testing purposes that can be quickly stood up using docker-compose.

# Docker

Docker is....  A container, not a VM

# Components

For those with access the Oracle files can be downloaded from https://edelivery.oracle.com.  The jdbc driver is available through http://oracle.com.

I don't have a location to get the JBoss files other than http://redhat.com.

## Application Server

JBoss EAP 5.1.2 is used.

## ATG / Oracle Commerce

The ATG install will use the images that has JBoss installed on it.

The oracle jdbc driver (ojdbc6.jar) is also installed from the tools/ folder.

## Endeca

Dockerfiles are provided for 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.  I'm in the processing of writing a file for 11.1

## Database

I'm using an existing image of xe

# Install Information

You will need to provide the necessary zip files provided by Oracle.  The ATG files are

By default the Endeca install is under /appl/endeca/.  

Copy the necessary Oracle supplied zip files to the /tools folder.

```

### Endeca 3.1.2

## XE Database

See the README notes on the xe database in the xe folder.  I'm using an existing image.

# Docker Compose

There is a docker compose file that will start the following three images.  I am still in the process of getting these integrated as a fully tested solution.
* storefront
* search
* database

# Various

The following is still in draft.
